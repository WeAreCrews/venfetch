# VenFetch
> [!NOTE]
>  Jealous of your Arch-using friends that seem to have no hobby beyond showing their neofetch? This can easily be solved thanks to venfetch, a plugin allowing you to show your superiority over your vanilla discord using friends. Simply enable the plugin and run /venfetch in a chat. It will send a neofetch-style message containing every useful detail about your Vencord install!
